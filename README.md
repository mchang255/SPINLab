# SPINLab

Welcome to the page where all the code that is used in SPINLab is published!

Description of programs in the repository:

magnetic_field.py - This code takes an input file, which contains the strengths of the Bx, By, Bz, and Bmod fields and the time at which the data was taken at, and plots time against each of the field strengths (magnetic_field_plot.png). In addition, this code also takes the average of Bx, By, Bz, and Bmod field and outputs it to a separate file (b_average.txt)

data.txt - the input file that is mentioned in the magnetic_field.py description.

To run all Python programs, open a terminal window and type "python name_of_program.py name_of_input_file.txt."
